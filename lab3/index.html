			<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>At first, I was really confused about how to insert a .jpg into VSCode. 
						It didn't want to accept my file, until I found a workaround. I had to drag the image in from its source, instead of 
						linking the image in VSCode itself. I'm not sure if that makes any sense, but thats how I can explain it.
						Also, resizing the image was a little confusing since I began doing it in html first, until I realized you requested we resize the image in CSS.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>I feel as though these kinds of assignments are really important. Where, we are are learning how to link files together.
						Also, I thought I was a genius when I was able to make a list that links to all the other labs, ha.
