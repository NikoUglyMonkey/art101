			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was difficult at first to break down games that we know like checkers into pseudocode. I had a hard time understanding and coming up with terminology
						that you would use.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Over all I think the assignment went well. Nathan helped me through task 2, so I could understand what exactly the different steps meant. 
						I think I can understand a little bit better how the process of coding goes from this assignment. 
					</p>

				//PB&J Task 1:
				Task 1:
				Making a PB&J Sandwich
				  Getting Ingredients and Tools
					  Bread
					  Peanut Butter
					  Jelly
					  Spreading Knife
				  Putting the Sauces on the Bread
					  Use the Spreading Knife
					  Gather jelly on the knife, and spread it on the first slice of bread.
					  Gather Peanut Butter on the knife, and spread it on the second slice of bread. 
				  Creating the Sandwich
					  Combine both the slices of bread with the ingredients facing towards each other.
				
				//Checkers Task 2:
				Checkers
				  Print the board before every turn
					  Make changes to the board regarding player moves
				  Accept User Input
					  Reveal possible moves for the piece that the player chooses
				  Execute User Input
					  Move pieces after user confirms their move
					  If the piece can make any more moves, let the player move that piece again.
					  If not, end the players turn
				  Create Possible Player Moves
					  Make the simple checkers piece able to only move forward
					  If the piece reaches the end of the board, promote it
					  The piece can now move forwards and backwards
				  Program AI for the Computer
					  Set up a neural network for the AI
					  Feed it hundreds of test data from previous checkers games found online.
					  Create 3 different difficulties
						Make different settings for each bot
				  Make the win condition
					  If a player loses all their pieces, they lose and the other player wins
					  If neither player can move, then it’s a draw
				  Create UI
					  Make the possible moves bright to make it noticeable to the player
					  When the game ends, show the player’s result
						Show 2 buttons
						  Play Again
						  Go Back to Title
