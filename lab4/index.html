			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was difficult at first to break down games that we know like checkers into pseudocode. I had a hard time understanding and coming up with terminology
						that you would use.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Over all I think the assignment went well. Nathan helped me through task 2, so I could understand what exactly the different steps meant. 
						I think I can understand a little bit better how the process of coding goes from this assignment.
