			<h1>Hello World.</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
			<p>
				Nathan and Niko are students at UCSC. We both have a passion for video games and would love to make them ourselves one day. 
				We view learning how to code as a challenging, but rewarding journey. Nathan loves to play Sekiro and Niko loves to play FPS games like Counter-Strike.

			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Basics</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to learn about HTML, CSS, and javascript
                        to the point where we can become proficient in using these languages.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>
					<p>At times when we were coding, there were some errors regarding HTML and CSS, whether it be forgetting semi-colons or not knowing how to change something. We fixed this
                        by searching on google for how to fix our errors, in addition to learning new facts about the languages.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? </p>
					<p>We often felt confused about which steps we needed to complete next. Also, we weren't sure whether or not we should create a new index.html file.
						We Both went into this assignment ready to learn with an open mind, though.
